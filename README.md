| [Client projects](https://github.com/trouthouse-tech) | Our projects are organized within their individual repositories|
| [Sprints](https://github.com/orgs/trouthouse-tech/projects/2) | The team's two-week sprints are managed through a GitHub Project board. Each sprint tracks GitHub Issues through to completion within their respective repositories. Being on a two-week cadence allows us to track the amount of spent on dedicated issues per project. |
| [Issues](https://github.com/trouthouse-tech/trouthousetech-docs/issues/new/choose)| Our projects are broken down into indidual subtasks called issues. Each issue tracks a given task with their listed requirements. Issues are defined internally but can also be created by our external clients. There are different issue templates for their respective tasks.|
| [Tracking](https://github.com/trouthouse-tech/trouthousetech-docs/issues/new/choose)| Here is a quick guide to our issue tracking process:  |
| Step 1. | `Issue Creation:` issue is created with the appropriate labels and requirments are outlined |

# TroutHouseTech Docs


## Welcome to our docs!

Here you'll find a quick guide on how we run our projects internally and externally. If you're new to the team, this is a great place to start to get familiar with some of our processese. If you're a new client, please take a look at some of our definitions, it will help us streamline communication.

| [Client projects](https://github.com/trouthouse-tech)                                           | Our projects are organized within their individual repositories|
| [Sprints](https://github.com/orgs/trouthouse-tech/projects/2) | The team's two-week sprints are managed through a GitHub Project board. Each sprint tracks GitHub Issues through to completion within their respective repositories. Being on a two-week cadence allows us to track the amount of spent on dedicated issues per project.                                                                                                                |
| [Issues](https://github.com/trouthouse-tech/trouthousetech-docs/issues/new/choose)| Our projects are broken down into indidual subtasks called issues. Each issue tracks a given task with their listed requirements. Issues are defined internally but can also be created by our external clients. There are different issue templates for their respective tasks.|
